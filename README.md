## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a bioinformatics associate at Zymo Research, where I develop AI applications for oncology research and engineer databases and pipelines for Next Generation Sequencing data. I hold a Master's degree in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, where I was advised by Dr. Martin Zhang. Prior to Zymo Research, I was a computational biologist intern at Foundation Medicine, working on minimum residual disease monitoring in cell-free DNA. My expertise spans statistical genomics, machine learning, and bioinformatics pipeline development for genomic datasets.
