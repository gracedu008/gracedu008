## Hi there 👋

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at UCLA. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Nanyun Peng and Prof. Kai-Wei Chang, focusing on problems in Multimodality (Vision + Language) and Embodied Learning. Prior to my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at Stanford SVL, working with Jiajun Wu and Fei-Fei Li.
